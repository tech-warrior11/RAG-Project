Welcome to the **Voice Enabled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project** — a next-generation multilingual voice intelligence platform. This application seamlessly bridges the gap between voice interaction and advanced AI knowledge retrieval, allowing users to ask questions in multiple Indian and global languages via voice and receive precise, spoken answers in their native tongue.

## ✨ Main Features

*   **🗣️ Multilingual Voice Interaction**: Ask questions directly by recording your voice live or by uploading an audio file (`.wav`). The system automatically detects and processes your query.
*   **🧠 Intelligent RAG Engine**: Utilizes **FAISS** and Sentence Transformers (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) for ultra-fast, context-aware information retrieval from vector databases.
*   **⚡ Ultra-Fast Latency Architecture**: Engineered for speed with built-in query caching and performance analytics to hit sub-10ms latency targets, complete with P50/P70/P100 benchmarking.
*   **🌍 Native Language Preservation**: Detects the language of the query and ensures the LLM replies accurately in the exact native script (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) without losing context in translation.
*   **🔊 Real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the AI-generated responses back to natural-sounding audio using `gTTS`, featuring adjustable voice playback speeds (0.5x to 2.0x).
*   **🎨 Stunning Dual-Theme UI**: A premium user interface featuring both a *Cyber Neon Dark Theme* and a *Neumorphic Light Theme*, complete with fluid animations, custom controls, and latency metrics.
